# temp-map
This is a visualization project for a climate change weekend workshop. We are using a few api to collect more recent data to make a heat map of temperature change.

We will be using [plotly](https://www.plot.ly/python/heatmaps) and Python 3.8 for visualization.

We will be managing more sensative information with a [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) files. check out [.config/.env](./.config/.env) for an example file.


## Getting started 

``` py
pip install --user -r requirment.txt
# add what you need to your dotenv file
python Main.py

```
